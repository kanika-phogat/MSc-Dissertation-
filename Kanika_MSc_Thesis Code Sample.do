****FROM CASH TO CLASSROOMS: DIRECT AND INDIRECT EFFECTS***
******OF A CONDITIONAL CASH TRANSFER PROGRAM ON GIRLS'*****
**********EDUCATION IN WEST BENGAL, INDIA******************
**********BY: KANIKA PHOGAT, BOCCONI UNIVERSITY************
***********************************************************


/* This code is part of my research evaluating the causal impact of a Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) program, the Kanyashree Prakalpa (henceforth, KP), on girls' education outcomes in West Bengal, India. The analysis uses Difference-in-Differences (DD) and Triple Differences (DDD) estimation strategies to evaluate the program's direct effects on eligible girls and its spillover effects on their younger ineligible siblings.

The code includes three main parts:

1. Data cleaning and merging: Prepares data for analysis by standardizing variable names acoss different years and creating new variables needed for the main analysis.

2. Main analysis: Checks for parallel trends assumptions and then implements DD and DDD estimation strategies to get causal ITT (intent to treat) effect of the CCT program.

3. Robustness checks: Conducts synthetic control analysis to validate findings from DD.

The data for this analysis was sourced from the ASER (Annual Status of Education Report) survey, conducted by Pratham, India.

///What you will find in Part I: 

*I) It appends yearly datasets and renames some variables.
*II) It creates outcome and control variables to prepare for main analysis. Please note that variable names and their values were heterogenous throughout the years. 

*Note: Original datasets covering all of India were provided in Excel. I first extracted the states I needed and addressed the inconsistencies within each year's data like number values stored as strings for the same variable in different years. This process was faster and easier in excel. After preparing and standardizing the data for each year in Excel, I imported and merged the clean datasets into Stata.

***********************************************************
**Part III: ROBUSTNESS CHECK - SYNTHETIC CONTROL METHOD****
***********************************************************

/*
This section implements the Synthetic Control Method (SCM) to validate the findings from the DD analysis. The goal here is to construct a synthetic version of West Bengal from untreated states in the donor pool. This synthetic unit will then serve as a control group.
*/

///What you will find in Part III: 

*I) Loading the cleaned and merged data from excel and declaring a balanced panel dataset
*II) Implementing SCM using synth2 


*Note:This part involved a separate process where I included nearly all states from the yearly Excel files to create the donor pool needed for constructing a synthetic West Bengal (the treated state). I then cleaned these Excel file with a  similar process used for the original analysis to ensure consistency in variables across states and years.

clear all 

use "$data/SCM merged file.dta", clear

* Restricting to  relevant sample for analysis

keep if female==1 
keep if age>=13 & age<=16

* Collapsing the data to ensure unique state code and year combinations

* Now declaring the panel data structure

xtset state_code year

* Now using Synth2 command for checking covariate balance in pre-treatment periods and plotting the enrollment trends for West Bengal and Synthetic West Bengal. I use all the original control variables and some lagged outcome variables to construct synthetic West Bengal. Treated unit or tru is 19 which is the state code for West Bengal and trp is treatment period as post intervention period starts from 2014 onwards.
